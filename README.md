#### By Logan Wu & Kevin Tokheim

## Description

This is an app which allows the user to input a number to count up to, and the multiple they want to use to count up to that number, whether it is divisible or not divisible, as long as the multiple is smaller than the number. The results, including the multiples, are displayed after the user clicks the button. If the number is not divisible, then the largest multiple that is smaller than the number is displayed.
